## CodeBreaker
### Small console game based on the popular board game Mastermind!

The rules are as follows: 
<br />
>- Each new game, the codemaker will generate a secret 4 digit code. 
>- Each code is UNIQUE. For example, 0123, 9548, and 3217 are valid codes, but 1102, 4445, and 7313 are not.
>- Once the number has been generated, you have **10** chances to guess the code before you get locked out of the system.
